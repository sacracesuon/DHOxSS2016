My dear sir,
<PERSON>Gavelle</PERSON> and I have much pleasure in accepting your friendly invitation for Friday at ? past 6.
In such a case as Mr <PERSON>Isaacson</PERSON>, [my Co] my editorial duties must be merely to see the MS through the press: I may not add, nor take away.  What I should propose is, that each author condense his own paper: for it is an awkward matter to shorten the noses of other people's children.  The 3 papers you have confided to me number 50 sides of MS: the quantity of type that will occupy depends upon the style of writing: I should say about 40 pages: if so, they are scarcely more than may fairly be set up verbatim.  
All prosperities to you & yours.  If ever you want to see me about the Volume, or anything else, I will if you send me times, call on you when in your morning gown.  Our kind regards to Mrs Pettigrew & you ??? & I am, 
Yours very truly

It strikes me I had better look in upon you soon, to settle about editorial duties.","5 New Burlington Street
